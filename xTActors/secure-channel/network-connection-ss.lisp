;; List of currently active sockets
;;
;; The socket is denoted externally by the encoder Actor used for
;; sending data through the socket. It is recorded here along with the
;; socket state, and an Actor to be used for its "Channel". Initially
;; both the socket and its channel are the same.
;;
;; Sockets marshal encode, whatever is being sent, into streams of
;; unsigned bytes, possibly compressed for network efficiency, then
;; chopped into packets of length no larger than 64KB. The original
;; data encoding is reassembled at the receiving end, then
;; decompressed and unmarshalled back into Lisp objects.
;;
;; Every socket also has an associated list of local-services, which
;; records session duration services, along with ephemeral reply
;; proxies on the client. An initial service is provided to enable a
;; negotiation for a secure encrypted channel. Encryption is a layer
;; above this socket layer. We have nothing to do with it here, except
;; to offer the initial per-socket local negotiation service.
;;
;; In this model, clients send commands and requests to a server.
;; Servers may or may not reply. Initially, only globally advertised
;; services are available at the server. But once a connection has
;; been established, parties are free to invent their own
;; sub-protocols.
;;
;; Received messages are dispatched to local-services.
;;
;; Message structure for clients:
;;      (SEND chan srv-id cust-id . message)
;;                |------------------------|
;;                         = message sent to server local services list.
;;
;; Message structure for server replies:
;;      (SEND chan cust-id . message)
;;                |-----------------|
;;                         = message sent to client local services list
;;
;; chan represents either the socket Actor or another (typ. encrypted)
;; channel Actor on the socket.
;;
;; srv-id and cust-id are locally generated UUID's denoting proxy
;; Actors registered in the local services list for the socket on
;; either side.  srv-id would be registered at the receiving server,
;; and cust-id will be registered at the sending client end.

    Message :ADD-SOCKET is sent during construction of the socket
    interface graph.
    
    Add an initial socket connection to our list of available
    connections. At this point the connection is not-encrypted.
    
    Look for an existing record for this same ip-addr:
   
      1. If we find one and it is a :PENDING-SERVER record, then
      record the STATE and SENDER (socket writer Actor) in the
      record.  This makes it no longer pending, and available for
      unsecured comms.
   
      2. Otherwise, if we found a record, and the STATE is not us,
      then shut the previous connection down. Record the new SENDER
      and STATE in the record.
   
      3. Else, no record was found, so construct a new one and add
      it to our list. That happens when a client wants a connection
      to a new server.

   Message :FIND-SOCKET is sent by client Actors on this machine,
   looking for a socket connection to a remote host.
   
   Look for an available connection already in place.
   
   If we find one, and it has no waiting list, then send its
   writer Actor to the customer as an available connection to the
   server.
   
   If we find one, but it has a waiting list, then join the wait -
   they are waiting on a successful handshake with the server. All
   will be notified if it completes.
   
   If no records are found for the server ip address, then
   construct one with us as the first waiting member, add the new
   record to the list, and then try to form a network TCP
   connection with the server.

   Mesasge :NEGOTIATE is sent after successfully forming a TCP
   connection with a server.
   
   The server is now waiting for us to start the DH handshake
   crypto-dance.
   
   Client Actors must await a secure channel. The only Actors that
   are permitted to communicate over an insecure channeol are
   those involved in the DH crypto-dance of the initial handshake
   with the server. And even that is encrypted in a different way.
   
   When an initial TCP connection is established with a server on
   the network, that server just sits there silently waiting for
   the handshake dance to begin from the client side. The server
   only responds if it recognizes the client and its encrypted
   handshae message.
   
   If we didn't find any record of this TCP connection in our
   list, then just play dumb and say :OK.
   
   Here STATE is the state devloped by the socket interface, and
   SOCKET is the unencrypted output Actor.
   
   All the SOCKET Actor does is to serialize whatever is being
   sent, then encode it into a self-sync byte streaam, before
   sending it out the physical async socket port. It doesn't even
   chop it into manageable blocks of data. So there will be some
   maximum size that can be transferred successfully across the TCP
   port.
   
   The server side has the same situation at this time. So whatever
   is transferred in either direction is done so in the clear,
   except for these simple encodings. Anyone listening with
   decoders for these serial protocols will be able to read what is
   sent.
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   ;; The initial X3DH handshake sends encrypted random numbers
   ;; across the cleartext link, along with small AES encrypted
   ;; packets containing connection info for each party.
   ;;
   ;; For Lattice Crypto, QC offers no advantage.
   ;;
   ;; For ECC we are subject to Shor's Algorithm O(log^2 N) for the
   ;; DLP, so we must choose a sufficiently large key size for
   ;; protection.
   ;;
   ;; But even in the case of ECC vulnerabilities against Schorr's
   ;; Algorithm in QC, busting open our crypto keying provides no
   ;; advantage because the messages passed are merely random numbers
   ;; and have no overt relation to the AES keying in the data
   ;; packets.
   ;;
   ;; No public keys are sent across the connection, just UUID's that
   ;; refer to previously arranged public keys. Cracking would have
   ;; to know the implicit public keys involved on both sides of the
   ;; communication channel. Those may be generally known for
   ;; advertised server nodes, but not for client nodes.
   ;;
   ;; With SHA3 hashes and AES/256 encryption, our data packets are
