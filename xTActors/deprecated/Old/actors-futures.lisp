 === Be careful! ===

Spinning off another thread to perform blocking actions with =BIND
leaves the Actor ready to handle new messages while awaiting the
continuation. That might mess up the single-thread semantics of the
Actor by potentially changing the internal state to something
incompatible with what the continuation expects.

In contrast, the use of RECV blocks all further message handling until
a proper response arrives and the matching RECV clause continues to
completion. All incoming messages that don't satisfy the RECV get
stashed for later processing after the RECV completes.

On the one hand, =BIND leaves us open to state misconfiguration due to
subseqent message handling during the continuation wait, which might
never arrive. On the other hand, RECV has the potential to block
further message processing forever, if a qualifying message never
arrives.
