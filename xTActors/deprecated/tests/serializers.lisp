;; This example shows that, even if you write FPL-pure code, you can
;; still have "mutability" of shared state as far as outside observers
;; see it. And you need to avoid concurrency data races.  Serializers
;; offer one way to fix the concurrency data race problem.

(defun cell-beh (value)
  ;; A shared "mutable" value cell
  ;;
  ;; Notice that even though we never physically mutate the value
  ;; parameter, to outside observers the cell state does appear
  ;; mutated via BECOME.

      (send cell value)))
   ))

(defun counter-svc-beh (cell)
  ;; a service to increment the value in the shared "mutable" cell.
  ;; 
  ;; The split-read/write for updating cell value works only when we
  ;; have just a single thread of execution performing this code.
  ;;
  ;; If any degree of concurrency exists, then immediately after our
  ;; :READ request, another concurrent thread could begin its own
  ;; execution of the same code, hence using the wrong initial value.
