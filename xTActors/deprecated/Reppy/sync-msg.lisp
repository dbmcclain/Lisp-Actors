;; sync-msg.lisp -- Composable Synchronous Events in Actors (AKA Reppy Channels)
;;
;; This is amazing! In about a page of code we can reproduce the
;; essentials of Reppy Channels, using Actors!  Reppy Channels are
;; composable synchronous rendezvous events, and Actors are completely
;; asynchronous. This is a parallel, concurrent, lock-free, FPL
;; design, written with a fraction of the effort.
;;
;; DM/RAL  02/22
;; -----------------------------------------
;; Be mindful that information flows in two directions among these
;; composed event networks. Control signals, (:SYNC and :RESET) flow
;; into the network, while channel responses flow back out of the
;; network and into the customer Actor.
;;
;; The ultimate sink, for both senders and receivers, is generally a
;; Channel - a rendezvous point.
;;
;; In general, we should make sure to allow information to flow back
;; to customer only once. And we need to protect against multiple
;; logical readers or writers from entering a rendezvous. So we make
;; reader and writer ports to channels go throughn a serializer, and
;; many wrapper events have Once protection on information flowing
;; back to the customer.
;;
;; Customer Actors should be prepared to handle rendezvous failures in
;; addition to normal traffic - at both ends, sender and receiver.
;;
;; Events, E, (here Actors) are produced by mappings f: f(E) -> E,
;; with composition defined by, f • g = f(g(E)).
