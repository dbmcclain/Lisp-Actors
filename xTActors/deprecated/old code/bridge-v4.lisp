;; actor-bridge.lisp -- The bridge needed to allow Actors to remotely interact

;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; The "Bridge" - a resident agent for transparent SEND/ASK across a
;; network connection to foreign Actors. A foreign Actor is identified
;; by IP Addr, Port, and Service name - aka PROXY,
;;
;; When a network connection becomes established, an entry is made in
;; the DESTS map, relating the stated IP Addr with the Actor
;; responsible for comms across that connection.
;;
;; When a caller wants to send a message across the network
;; connection, and include a reply-to callback, it must represent that
;; callback closure using a UUID. The foreign system can forward reply
;; SENDS to that closure using the UUID. Back at the original sender
;; side, that UUID can be translated back into the actual closure code
;; to perform.
;;
;; Users can produce UUID -> Continuation mappings for other purposes
;; than a reply-to address. In that case, the Handler will be NIL.
;;
;; These UUID -> Continuation mappings are ephemeral, being removed
;; from the map upon invocation.
