(defun encryptor (ekey)
  ;; Takes a bytevec and produces an encrypted bytevec.
  ;;
  ;; Since we are encrypting via XOR with a random mask, we must
  ;; ensure that no two messages are ever encrypted with the same XOR
  ;; mask. We do that by ensuring that every encryption is by way of a
  ;; new mask chosen from a PRF. This is one-time-pad encryption.
  ;;
  ;; BTW... precisely the same is true for AES/CTR encryption. For
  ;; that you need a nonce to start the CTR of the mode. A nonce is
  ;; the analog of our seq.
  ;;
  ;; We use SHA3/256 as that PRF, taking the hash of the master
  ;; encryption key concatenated with a nonce. The nonce is sent along
  ;; with the encrypted data so that downstream decoders using the
  ;; same master encryption key can successfully decrypt the
  ;; cyphertext.
  ;;
  ;; Our nonces are guaranteed unique to each machine and to never
  ;; coincide with a nonce used previously on any machine. To ensure
  ;; use-once, every get-nonce request returns the current nonce
  ;; value, and immediately increments it before the next request.
  ;;
  ;; So even if the same master encryption key is reused, every
  ;; encryption will be using its own unique keying to generate the
  ;; XOR mask.
  ;;
  ;; -----------------------
  ;;
  ;; But even with perfectly random sampling of a finite number field,
  ;; hash collisions are a remote possibility, and could occur after
  ;; roughly 2^128 (~3e38) hashes, even as they all use unique keying.
  ;; We are mapping, via hashing, some 512 bits of key information,
  ;; down to 256 bits of hash mask. So there must be an enormous
  ;; number of hash collision preimages.
  ;;
  ;; On average, every hash mask corresponds to at least 2^256
  ;; different possible key patterns. But from an initial field of 512
  ;; bits, those 2^256 synonyms would be rare to find.
  ;;
  ;; To see a hash collision in the XOR masking, with its 256 bits,
  ;; with only a 1:1,000,000 chance of happening, would require
  ;; encrypting messages every microsecond, 24/7, for the next 2.5
  ;; billion years.
  ;;
  ;; -----------------------
  ;;
  ;; Secrecy is protected because of the one-wayness of the Sha3/256
  ;; hash function. It is infeasible to determine a hash preimage from
  ;; a hash value.
  ;;
  ;; Attackers can discern the XOR mask for one message by encrypting
  ;; a known plaintext, then XOR the encryption result with that
  ;; plaintext. But seeing one, or even multiple, encryption XOR masks
  ;; is not helpful in any way to them. It tells them nothing about
  ;; the next encryption, even with foreknowledge about what nonce
  ;; will be used, unless they also have the master encryption key.
  ;;
  ;; Knowing what nonce will be used, if attackers also knew that
  ;; master encryption keys were short enough, they could mount a
  ;; brute force attack over the field of possible master encryption
  ;; keys. So it is incumbant on us to maintain sufficiently large
  ;; master encryption keys. For that purpose we also use randomly
  ;; generated Sha3/256 hash values. With 256 bits of master keying,
  ;; it becomes infeasible to mount a brute-force attack.
  ;;
  ;; By default, we use Diffie-Hellman secret key agreement between
  ;; client and server, based on Elliptic Curve Ed1174, which has a
  ;; field size of 2^249 bits. A random point, of size 2^251 bits,
  ;; from Curve Ed1174, is fed to SHA3/256 to derive the master
  ;; encryption key for the session. Those fields are still large
  ;; enough to prevent brute-force attacks.

;; Encrypted Disk Files - AONT Encoding
;;
;; File is saved in self-sync encoding. That doesn't help much if the
;; encrypted portions of the file get clobbered, but could help in the
;; recovery of remaining items. File uses flexible length encodings
;; rather than fixed allocations.

    +------------------------------------+
    | File Type UUID                     | = AONT type {b532fc4e-bf2b-123a-9307-24f67702cdaa}
    +------------------------------------+
    | (LIST pkey-vec encr-data aont-vec) |
    +------------------------------------+

  The encr-data in the :TEXT section is a marshal encoding of a list of 3 items:
   (LIST seq cipher-text sig)
  where,
    seq = the subkey of this encryption. Actual encryption key is H(master-key | seq).
    cipher-text = encrypted, compressed, marshaled list of Lisp data items.
    sig = signature on (seq cipher-text) and validated against pkey.

  The sig is an authentication of the written data.
  Encryption is by way of XOR with one-time pad.
  
  There is no relation between pkey and the master encryption key. The
  skey and pkey can be chosen independently from the master encryption
  key. skey and pkey of creator are related through EdEC Curve1174.

  This is *Confidential* encoding, not *SECRET*. Anyone can read this
  data, provided they read all of it first, and can then derive the
  master encryption key. This takes special effort, and so the data is
  not visible to the casual reader.
