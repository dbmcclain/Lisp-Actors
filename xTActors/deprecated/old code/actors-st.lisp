;; Caution!! It is not safe to enable an Actor if its message queue
;; appears empty. It might still be runinng the last message
;; presented. We need to ensure single-thread semantics for all
;; Actors. That's why there is a busy-bit.
;;
;; That busy bit gets unset only after the Actor has completed message
;; processing and no more messages remain in its message queue.
