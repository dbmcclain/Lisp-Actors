;; actors-machine.lisp -- Emulator for an Actors Machine
;;
;; The rationale for this is here:
;; http://www.dalnefre.com/wp/2022/08/memory-safety-simplifies-microprocessor-design/
;;
;; A pure Actors Machine is simpler, more secure, and uses less power
;; to accomplish feats.
;;
;; Here I am experimenting with a twist on the architecture mentioned
;; in the paper. I am allowing multiple invocation of the same Actor
;; so we have true parallelism, at the granularity of an Actor
;; A-Machine instruction, all within one running machine thread.
;;
;; The paper takes a more restrictive stance in that any one Actor can
;; only be running one invocation at a time. That makes it safe to
;; peform mutation on shared data. But since the Commit/Fail protocol
;; requires all visible changes to be rolled back on failure, it is
;; simpler to just avoid mutation of shared data, using FPL code, in
;; which case there is no reason to avoid parallel invocations.
;;
;; We accomplish this multiple-invocation by having each running
;; instance carry its own context.  The context is what identifies any
;; particular invocation. That context is sent back and forth between
;; the Actor and the A-Machine. Only the A-Machine peers inside, and
;; makes mutable changes to it.
;;
;; The Actor never mutates anything visible outside itself. It uses
;; pure FPL code. Only the A-Machine mutates anything, and it is very
;; restricted. Since there is only one running thread in the
;; A-Machine, there is no danger here.
;;
;; On an A-Machine, you have instruction level concurrency. We have
;; only 8 instructions in the emulated A-Machine:
;;
;;   -----------------------
;;   :SEND -- (ctxt cont :SEND target . msg)
;;   Enqueues a message send. Will be sent at final commit. Args ctxt
;;   and cont are the context object for the Actor invocation, and the
;;   continuation Actor for resumption (typically a β Actor).
;;
;;   Unlike Call/Return CPS, we are using Actors and SEND to effect
;;   continuation resumption.
;;
;;   -----------------------
;;   :BECOME -- (ctxt cont :BECOME new-beh)
;;    Allows an Actor to mutate its behavior and/or state upon final
;;    commit.
;;
;;   -----------------------
;;   :CREATE -- (ctxt cont :CREATE beh)
;;   Creates a new A-Machine AM-ACTOR with the indicated behavior. On
;;   the continuation resumption, that new Actor will be handed back
;;   to the sending Actor as an argument for its own use.
;;
;;   -----------------------
;;   :OPER -- (ctxt cont :OPER fn . args)
;;   A catchall opcode, allowing the Actor to perform any other Lisp
;;   operation, but only one, before being rescheduled at the back of
;;   the instruction queue, to give other Actors a chance to run.
;;
;;   -----------------------
;;   :CONT -- (ctxt cont :CONT . args)
;;   Issued only by the A-Machine CPU to schedule a continuation for
;;   an Actor.
;;
;;   -----------------------
;;   :RX -- (:RX target . msg)
;;   An event from a SEND has arrived. Causes the A-Machine CPU to
;;   construct an initial context, and enqueues a continuation for the
;;   target Actor at its behavior entry point.
;;
;;   -----------------------
;;   :COMMIT -- (ctxt :COMMIT)
;;   Commits all pending SEND and BECOME, and terminates the running
;;   of the Actor. No continuation after this instruction.
;;
;;   The context argument contains all the necessary information. If
;;   the parallel operation of the Actor is the first to BECOME and
;;   reach commit, then it takes the day. Otherwise, the Actor gets
;;   retried from its beginning.
;; 
;;   If an Actor never issues BECOME, then it simply sends all
;;   committed message SENDS.
;;
;;   A commit is the final insruction in an Actor. Any errors along
;;   the way will prevent reaching this final instruction.
;;
;;   -----------------------
;;   :EXIT -- not really an instruction op-code. But gives us a way to
;;   have the A-Machine terminate is activity.
;;
;; Our A-Machine Actors are a subtype of ACTOR. Normal message SEND
;; works on them, just as with any Actor. But they can be
;; distinguished using AM-ACTOR-P, and they are expected to behave
;; differently, issuing instruction-level messages to the A-Machine,
;; and they always need a context argument in first place.
;;
;; Any messages sent to their outer wrapper Actor from the outside
;; Actors system will result in an :RX instruction being sent to the
;; A-Machine for the corresponding embedded A-Machine Actor.
;;
;; Similarly, the A-Machine Actors are permitted to send to other
;; A-Machine Actors and also to outside Actors. But they should issue
;; a :SEND instruction, and not use a normal SEND. A normal SEND will
;; be immediate, not staged for later commit. These AM-ACTORS are not
;; operating under the transactioning protocol of normal Actors. They
;; have their own transaction protocol, enforced by the A-Machine CPU.
;;
;; Due to the design of this emulator, it calls for CPS-like code
;; inside the A-Machine Actors, using contination Actors (e.g., β
;; forms). I try to ease that by using alternate syntax: SENDING,
;; instead of SEND, BECOMING instead of BECOME, CREATING instead of
;; CREATE, and OPERATING.
;;
;; I also implemented a dynamic binding for the running context, which
;; must always be passed back and forth in first position. The
;; Customer argumemnt, which normally occupies first position, is now
;; in second position. But thanks to Lisp dynamic binding we can hide
;; that fact, and keep things looking like always with customer in
;; first position in the code we write.
;;
;; What we really need here is a CPS Conversion at the Actor level,
;; which requires a code walker and a lot more effort. For now we just
;; do the conversion by hand.
