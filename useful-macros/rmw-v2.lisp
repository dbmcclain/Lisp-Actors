;; To overcome the RMW ABA-Problem...
;;
;; We need to guard against ABA hazards during RMW. So we perform RMW
;; with a 2-phase protocol: First acquire its value, while marking
;; place as in-progress for update. The marking is done with a
;; descriptor that enables any thread to help toward completion if we
;; get interrupted. Then carry out the computation of the new value
;; and perform the update, if it hasn't already been done by anther
;; thread on our behalf. This protocol requires two CAS operations.
;;
;; We can no longer simply read nor write the value in a shared
;; location.  It might be in a state that is being updated by another
;; thread. If so, we nudge it along to final resolution before
;; acquiring/setting its value.
;;
;; As long as all modofiations to place are performed with WR or RMW
;; then we can be assured that there will be no ABA hazards. Reading
;; of place should be performed with RD, which helps push along any
;; update in progress before returning its stable value.
;;
;; Mutations performed with WR and RMW force all pending reads/writes
;; to be completed, and ensures cache coherency with other cores by
;; invalidating their cache lines for mutated place.
;;
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------
;; Assured lock-free, ABA hazard immune, mutation
;;
;; We need two primitives for every class of object:
;;  (BASIC-VAL obj) - returns the value contained in obj at this moment.
;;  (BASIC-CAS obj old new) - accomplishes a CAS on obj, returning T/F.
;;
;; We can't really know what value is held in obj for any length of
;; time after our mutation of it.  Another thread could come along and
;; mutate right after we did.  So we break precedent with SETF and
;; don't bother returning what we just set it to. When you need to
;; know what value is held in obj, perform a RD on it to get the value
;; it had at the time of the RD call.

;; ---------------------------------------------
;; This version uses a 2-phase approach, where competing threads help
;; complete an attempt in progress before launching their own.
;;
;; It has a theoretically bounded number of CAS attempts (= N+1) for N
;; competing threads. If a thread cannot complete, another thread will
;; do so for it.
