;; Define a constructor for encapsulated types. These envelopes become
;; useful for CLOS dispatching, and keep the contents opaque. In the
;; macro, arguments:
;;
;;  enc - is the name of the encapsulated type. As a function it
;;  constructs a new one whose opaque contents are provided as its
;;  sole constructor argument.
;;
;;  pred - is the name of a predicate for type testing
;;
;;  dec - is the deconstructor which returns its opaque contents.
;;
;; The envelopes are also convenient ref objects whose opaque contents
;; may be mutated (or not). But when the contents represent mutable
;; objects, the only way to record a mutation is to modify the
;; reference contained in the envelope, using (SETF (DEC obj)).
