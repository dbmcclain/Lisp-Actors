;; RECV -- selective retrieval of messages
;;
;; Any messages not matching one of the RECV clauses gets stashed in a
;; FIFO queue for later replay after the RECV clause either succeeds
;; or times out.
;;
;; Until a qualifying message arrives, or the timeout happens, the
;; Actor responds only to the messages handled in the RECV.

(defmacro recv-match (&rest clauses)
  ;;
  ;; a RECV-MATCH uses Optima:MATCH style patterns and clauses.
  ;; Use RECV for DLAMBDA-style patterns.
  ;;
  ;; RECV receives and processes one qualifying message, or gets timed
  ;; out. Messages arriving at the Actor's mailbox which do not
  ;; qualify for any of the RECV clauses will be stashed during the
  ;; waiting period. RECV operates asynchronously and does not block
  ;; waiting.
  ;;
  ;; After RECV either times out or receives a qualifying message, the
  ;; original message hander of the Actor is restored, and the stashed
  ;; messages will be replayed for processing before querying the
  ;; mailbox for new messages.
  ;;
  ;; If there is a :TIMEOUT expression inside the RECV-MATCH form, the
  ;; Actor will setup a timeout timer on that expression. If a
  ;; qualifying message does not arrive before the timer expires, a
  ;; timeout will occur. That timeout will execute the form listed
  ;; after :ON-TIMEOUT if given.
  ;;
  ;; In the macro, we parse the handler body to create a function
  ;; which takes a message and returns a fully deconstructed pattern
  ;; match closure, or nil. This allows us to cancel any pending
  ;; timeout if a message qualifies.
  ;;
  ;; An Actor containing a RECV form will not execute that form until
  ;; it receives some message that causes it to execute a branch of
  ;; code contained in the RECV form. All other messages remain pending.
