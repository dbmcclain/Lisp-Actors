;; stactors/promises - this is almost too easy...
;;
;; Promises represent async action deferral. Wrap a body of code with
;; PROMISE. The code will be performed asynchronously with the running
;; thread, and the PROMISE form will return a promise object to the
;; current thread. WHen you are ready for the results, call REALIZE on
;; the returned promise.
;;
;; Action code can produce errors, and those will be reflected back to
;; the caller of the PROMISE form, and raised upon REALIZE. You can
;; surround your REALIZE call with HANDLER-CASE or HANDLER-BIND in
;; order to deal with them.
;;
;; If a new promise is based on first realizing a previous promise,
;; just remember that the body of code doing the realizing may need
;; its own handlers, since it might be running in a separate thread
;; from the main running thread. (It will be if REALIZE is wrapped by
;; PROMISE.)
;;
;; If you try to REALIZE a promise before it has been fulfilled, you
;; will block waiting for its delivery.
;;
;; A promise can be realized any number of times, and each time will
;; return the same answer or raise the same error. You can hand off a
;; promise to any other thread for realization. Promises can yield
;; multiple values.
;;
;; -------------------
;; Added FULFILL to grant more flexibility in fulfilling promises. Use
;; with WITH-PROMISE around a body of code. That body is responsible
;; for calling FULFILL on the named promise arg of the WITH-PROMISE.
;; That code can run anywhere you deem most appropriate. The
;; WITH-PROMISE returns a new promise object to the caller of the
;; form.
;;
;; Interesting aside... Apart from the SPAWN-WORKER in PROMISE, this
;; code has general utility and is otherwise independent of Actors.
;; Also does not depend on CPS.
