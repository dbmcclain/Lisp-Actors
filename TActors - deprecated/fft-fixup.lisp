;; fft-fixup.lisp -- Replace lock-based code in FFT package with an Actors-based solution
;;
;; DM/RAL 06/21
;; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;; FFT Setups are allocated by the Apple VecLib as C-structs that must
;; be created before first use, and destroyed when no longer needed.
;; They are allocated in the C Heap.
;;
;; Here we use an Actors based approach toward managing these FFT
;; Setups. (Twiddle factors). An FFT needs twiddle factors at least as
;; large as its ceiling log2 size, or larger.
;;
;; We make use of LW's Special Free Actions called by the GC to remove
;; these C structs, but only after they have aged at least 30 sec.
;; This avoids constantly creating and releasing in quick succession.
;; Chances are pretty good that, if you used a particular size FFT,
;; you will use that same size (or larger) again. By keeping them
;; alive for at least 30 sec we keep the overhead of constructing them
;; to acceptably low frequency.
