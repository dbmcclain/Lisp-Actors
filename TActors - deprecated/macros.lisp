;; BETA Forms - A BETA form takes advantage of a Common Lisp pun, to
;; define an anonymous Actor which can be referred to in a subsequent
;; SEND, or some function which will eventually SEND, by the name
;; BETA, up until the next BETA form, which rebinds BETA. (BETA, cf. B
;; for Binding)
;;
;; ACTOR serves the same purpose for Actors that LAMBDA serves for
;; functions. ACTOR generates an anonymous Actor that can be LET bound
;; to some named binding.
;;
;; BETA extends this by providing a binding form for message arguments
;; that would arrive from a subsequent SEND, and then allows the body
;; function of the Actor to describe actions utilizing those message
;; args when they arrive. So BETA sets up an Actor continuation.
;;
;; BETA forms are nothing more than syntax sugar to make the use of
;; continuation Actors more readable. You could instead just define
;; the continuation Actor with a LET binding and then SEND a message
;; referring to it as an eventual message customer. But that separates
;; the Actor from the SEND which generates an eventual message to the
;; Actor. The BETA form allows their relationship to be more directly
;; discerned.
;;
;; BETA forms have a syntax reminiscent of DESTRUCTURING-BIND and
;; MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND. The bindings are on the first line, followed
;; by a generator form - a SEND which will use this BETA Actor as a
;; message argument - and then follows the body of the Actor's
;; behavior function.
;;
;;  (BETA (args)
;;     (SEND diddly BETA)
;;    body-of-Actor-behavior)
;;
;; BETA forms come it two varieties. Just as Actors can be
;; parameterized by local state, as well as from message arguments, so
;; too can BETA forms. The normal argument list, like that just shown
;; above, for a BETA form describes an Actor which can only accept
;; message arguments for its parameterization - in addition to those
;; also provided by capture from the enclosing lexical context.
;;
;; But when an argument list contains a group of symbols followed by
;; "/" then those symbols before the slash separator are taken to mean
;; Actor parameters furnished at Actor construction time. Those args
;; following the separator represent message args as a result of a
;; SEND.
;;
;;   (BETA (param / arg)
;;       (SEND diddly (BETA paramVal))
;;     body-of-Actor-behavior)
;;
;; For the unparameterized version of BETA forms, you mention the Actor
;; by BETA in a SEND. But in a parameterized version you must make a
;; function call to BETA with parameter args, as in (BETA arg1 arg2 ...). In
;; effect, the parameterized version of BETA actually represents an Actor
;; generating function.
;;
;; When you need to refer explicitly to that generating function it
;; goes by the name #'BETA-GEN. But in normal use a function call form
;; with BETA in first position serves to call #'BETA-GEN. The values
;; of BETA and #'BETA-gen are available to the body code of the Actor
;; up until they are rebound by an inner BETA form.
;;
;; For use by BECOME, the parameterized behavior generator is named
;; #'BETA-BEH.
;;
;; ------------------------------------------------------------------
;; NOTE: Watch out for the following trap... A BETA form in an Actor
;; effectively spawns a new Actor, and the containing host Actor
;; simply skips over the BETA form. The host Actor and the BETA actor
;; run concurrently.
;;
;; The containing Actor could exit, then respond to a new message in
;; parallel with a waiting BETA Actor.  That could also modify the
;; conditions, e.g., external hardware ports could get closed, before
;; the BETA form executes. And that BETA form might be expecting a
;; continuity of external conditions. You might need IGNORE-ERRORS
;; inside that BETA form.
;;
;; A BETA form *does not* force serialized execution!! They operate
;; concurrently with the host Actor. Nested BETA forms, however, do
;; operate sequentially.
